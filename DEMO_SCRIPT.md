### **2. SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK (1 minute)**
**Say:** *"Let me first show that all 8 services are running and healthy"*

**Run commands:**
```bash
# Show all containers status
docker-compose ps

# Quick health checks
echo "=== Backend API ==="
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health

echo "=== Frontend Status ==="
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000

echo "=== All 8 services operational! ==="
```

---

### **3. FRONTEND DASHBOARD (2 minutes)**
**Say:** *"Now let's explore the React frontend dashboard"*

**Open browser:** `http://localhost:3000`

**Navigate and explain:**
- Point to "Real-time CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring" header
- Show the metrics display section
- **Click each service link to demonstrate they work:**
  - Backend API (3001) 
  - Sample App (3002)
  - Prometheus (9090)
  - Grafana (3003) ‚Üê **Mention this was recently fixed**
- Scroll down to show AI development section

---

### **4. BACKEND API DEMO (1.5 minutes)**
**Say:** *"The backend provides RESTful APIs for metrics collection"*

**Open new tab:** `http://localhost:3001/api/health`

**Show in terminal:**
```bash
# Demonstrate API endpoints
echo "=== Health Endpoint ==="
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

echo "=== Dashboard Metrics ==="
curl http://localhost:3001/api/metrics/dashboard

echo "=== Build Information ==="
curl http://localhost:3001/api/builds
```

**Explain:** *"Notice the JSON responses with CORS headers for cross-origin access"*

---

### **5. MONITORING STACK (2 minutes)**

#### **Prometheus:**
**Open new tab:** `http://localhost:9090`
- Navigate to Status ‚Üí Targets
- **Say:** *"All targets are UP and being monitored"*
- Go to Graph tab, run query: `up`
- **Say:** *"This shows real-time metrics collection"*

#### **Grafana:**
**Open new tab:** `http://localhost:3003`
- **Say:** *"Grafana provides advanced visualization and alerting"*
- Show the interface (login if needed: admin/admin123)
- Navigate through available options

---

### **6. JENKINS PIPELINE (1.5 minutes)**
**Say:** *"Let me show the comprehensive Jenkins pipeline configuration"*

**Show in terminal/editor:**
```bash
# Show Jenkins pipeline
head -50 Jenkinsfile
echo "=== This pipeline includes ==="
echo "‚úÖ Build, Test, Security Scan stages"
echo "‚úÖ Deployment with health checks" 
echo "‚úÖ Metrics collection and reporting"
echo "‚úÖ Slack/Email notifications"
```

**Open Jenkinsfile in editor and scroll through key sections**

---

### **7. DOCKER ARCHITECTURE (1 minute)**
**Say:** *"The entire system is containerized with Docker"*

**Show commands:**
```bash
# Show docker architecture
docker-compose ps
echo "8 microservices working together"

# Show networking
docker network ls | grep monitoring
echo "Custom network for service discovery"

# Show volumes
docker volume ls | grep cicd
echo "Persistent data storage"
```

---

### **8. DOCUMENTATION (1 minute)**
**Say:** *"Complete documentation was delivered as required"*

**Show files:**
```bash
# Show documentation structure
ls docs/
echo "=== Requirements Analysis ==="
head -10 docs/requirement-analysis.md

echo "=== Technical Design ==="
head -10 docs/tech-design.md

echo "=== AI Usage Logs ==="
head -10 docs/ai-prompt-logs.md
```

---

### **9. CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)**
**Say:** *"Let me summarize what we've built"*

**Final commands:**
```bash
echo "üéØ SYSTEM SUMMARY:"
echo "‚úÖ 8 microservices - All healthy and operational"
echo "‚úÖ Real-time monitoring dashboard with React frontend"
echo "‚úÖ Complete Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with metrics"
echo "‚úÖ Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack"
