# CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring & Alerting System

## üéØ Project Overview
A comprehensive real-time CI/CD pipeline monitoring and alerting system that collects, visualizes, and analyzes build metrics while providing intelligent notifications for pipeline failures and performance issues.

This system demonstrates modern DevOps practices with AI-assisted development, providing a complete monitoring solution for Jenkins pipelines with advanced visualization and alerting capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üìä Real-time Metrics Collection
- Build success/failure rates with trend analysis
- Average build times across different stages
- Last build status monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking
- Historical data retention and analytics

### üìà Interactive Dashboard
- Real-time pipeline status overview
- Build success/failure rate visualizations
- Build duration trend charts
- Recent builds with detailed information
- Filtering by project, time range, and environment

### üö® Intelligent Alerting System
- **Slack Integration**: Rich formatted notifications with contextual information
- **Email Alerts**: Professional HTML templates with build details
- **Webhook Support**: Custom integrations with external systems
- **Smart Rules**: Configurable alert conditions and cooldown periods

### üê≥ Modern Deployment
- Complete Docker containerization
- Multi-environment support (development, staging, production)
- Health checks and monitoring
- Load balancing with Nginx
- Prometheus & Grafana integration

- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Jenkins instance (for integration)
- Git

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cicd-monitoring-system
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment example
cp environment.example .env

# Edit configuration (required)
nano .env
```

### 3. Start the System
```bash
# Quick setup with script
./setup.sh

# Or manual setup
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 4. Access Applications
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:3001/api
