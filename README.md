## Architecture
```
Application → Build → Test → Security Scan → Deploy → Health Check → Monitor
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Jenkins instance (for integration)
- Git

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpitzn/CI-CD-Jenkins-Pipeline-HealthCheck.git
cd CI-CD-Jenkins-Pipeline-HealthCheck
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment example
cp environment.example .env

# Edit configuration (required)
nano .env
```

### 3. Start the System
```bash
# Quick setup with script
./setup.sh

# Or manual setup
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 4. Access Applications
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **API**: http://localhost:3001/api
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin123)
