## 5. Integration Points

### 5.1 Jenkins Integration
```
Jenkins Pipeline → Webhook → Metrics Collector → Database → Dashboard
                              ↓
                         Alert Engine → Slack/Email
```

### 5.2 Data Flow
1. Jenkins pipeline executes and sends webhook data
2. Metrics collector processes build information
3. Data is stored in MongoDB with real-time updates via Redis
4. Dashboard displays updated metrics
5. Alert engine evaluates rules and sends notifications
